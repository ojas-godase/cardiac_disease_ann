This code predicts the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease using multiple machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). It trains each model on patient health metrics and then uses the models to predict heart disease risk, evaluating their performance to identify the most accurate predictor.
